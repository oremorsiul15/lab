// Using the following rules of the construction site:
//     N construction workers are taking turns to move stones.
//     There are the same amount of stones as construction workers.
//     In order to take turns first any worker moves 2 stones.
//     Secondly, a worker that already moved 2 stones can only then move a single stone.
//     The only stones that worker A can move are stones A-1, A, and A+1. ('A' being a number greater or equal than 0).
//     There are not a stone numbered less than 0 and greater than N.
//     The worker can move any random stones near them.
//     If a worker has not moved any stone they must wait for two available stones to move at the same time.
//     If a worker has already moved their first two stones and there isn't any single stone to move they must wait until there is an available stone.
//     Any worker finished their job if they completed the steps previously explained.

// Implement using pthreads and pthreads mutex locks.

// Your program should print the worker that is moving stones, the stones they are moving, and when the worker finished moving any stone.

// NOTE: Assume that there is at least 2 construction workers.

// NOTE: If there are more than 2 stones to choose from, select stones A-1 and A.

// NOTE: You can use int rand() function from the standard library (stdlib.h) to get a random integer.

// NOTE: Code is compiled with gcc on a posix compliant operating system

// To ease coding on a IDE (VSCode) copy all code from the answer box and paste it on IDE text editor. To compile run build task (Terminal>Run Build Task...). To run the code open a new terminal (Terminal>New Terminal) if there isn't one already open and type ./prog <arg> (substitute <arg> to number of workers to test your code).

// The output should look like this: (remember the order of the lines is not enforced)

// Worker 0 is moving stones 0 and 1
// Worker 0 finished moving 2 stones
// Worker 0 is moving stone 1
// Worker 0 finished moving 1 stone
// Worker 1 is moving stones 0 and 1
// Worker 1 finished moving 2 stones
// Worker 1 is moving stone 0
// Worker 1 finished moving 1 stone
